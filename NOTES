* TODO Items
- [ ] Re-arrange the example files into directories
  - Currently all under file:examples/ but could organize these a bit
    more with its own README
- [ ] Remove the need to pass 'cat' as the filter to various
  TESTY_MULTI commands
- [ ] Add signal handling to do cleanup if needed
- [ ] Adjust standard single tests to add failures to lists like they
  do in TESTY_MULT
- [ ] Explore use of Bash's built-in co-processes to see if that would
  simplify the overall design
- [ ] Remove use of 'mkfifo', perhaps FIFOs altogether as this feature
  does not work on Windows file systems under the WSL


* Multi Process testing

** notes 
- the example above illustrates that this command set as it would
  exist in testy looks more like another interpreter of some type
- as I have started to experiment with coding it in bash, it feels
  more like a subprogram
- particularly the declarations about output would be nice for testy
  to have inline and then just check the output lines as if it was an
  interpreter
- this would create a dependency on another file thought which is a
  little undesirable

- Altered the syntax away from the above somewhat but the general
  scheme is still what I ended up using
- see the banter/ directory for an example
