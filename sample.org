* Test echo 
Check that the 'echo' command in bash is working.

The 'sh' is not honored in testy; it is for easy editing in Emacs.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
>> echo 'hello'
hello
>> echo 'Hi there!'
Hi there!
#+END_SRC

* Test printf
Tests whether printf works.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
>> printf "Hello world\n"
Hello world
>> printf "Multi-line\noutput is expected\nhere\n"
Multi-line
output is expected
here
>> printf "%s\n" "substitute
#+END_SRC

This second session below will fail and record the results of the
failure in a file.
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
>> echo 'hi'
hi
>> printf 'INTENTIONAL fail\n'
INTENTIONALly fails
#+END_SRC

* Test bc

This test uses a different interpreter than the standard 'bash'. The
'bc' program interprets standard mathematical expressions. Note the
use of #+TESTY expression to change the program for this test.

#+TESTY: program="bc -iq"
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
>> 1+1
2
>> 3*5+12
27
#+END_SRC
