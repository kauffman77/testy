#+TESTY: TAG bc-echo

* Echoing 'input'
Subtraction tests with echo style 'input' : bc will echo the input
itself so it does not need to appear in the test session.

* Mistake in test results
Subtraction tests. Due to the -i option, input is echoed after
receiving it from testy.

This test should fail as the input is repeated in the expected output
below, both on the prompt and after it. This is not how to set up a
test properly at this time.
