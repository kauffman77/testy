This directory contains some tests for a multi-program executable
using the TESTY_MULTI feature that was present in the old bash version
of testy (called ~testyb~) in the main directory. This feature has not
been ported to the main Python version yet so these tests won't work
with but likely still work with ~testyb~ via
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
>> testyb banter_tests.org
#+END_SRC
