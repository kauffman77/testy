#+TITLE: Tests of the bc program
# the title to display when running the tests

# the lines below set some global options for all tests which may be
# overridden in invididual tests.

#+TESTY: PREFIX="bctests" 
# a prefix for the results files that will appear in the test-results/
# directory; the default prefix is "test" but when multiple test files
# are present such as for multiple problems, it's handy to distinguis
# them. 

#+TESTY: PROGRAM="bc -iq" 
# the default program to run, in this case the standard interactive
# calculator program "bc"; the -iq options force an interactive
# setting (-i) and silence the welcome message copyright when starting
# the program (-q).

* (FIRST TEST) Addition and Multiplication 
# The above line indicates the start of a test with its title.

Some add/multiply tests
# This line is a comment on the intent of the test.

# Below is a "session" which will run the program `bc -iq` and feed in
# the input given on ">>" lines and check that the output matches the
# other lines. The "text" designator has no effect in testy and can be
# left off or chosen to make Emacs Org-Mode display code blocks with
# syntax highlighting.

# Below is a second test with similar features to the first.

* (SECOND TEST) No -q option; likely fail
# test title above and comments below

The 'program' for this test is changed to ~bc -i~; since the ~-q~
option is omitted, the startup is not "quiet" and so the tests output
should include the startup message for ~bc~. This test will fail
unless you just happen to have the exact version of bc reported below.

#+TESTY: program="bc -i"
# This line overrides the program to run; instead of `bc -iq`, the
# above program will run which shows the welcome message. The test
# session is below.
