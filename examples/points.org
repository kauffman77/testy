#+title: Demonstrate Points System for Tests

#+TESTY: use_points=True
# use points instead of passed tests

#+TESTY: points_scale=0.5
# scale the available/earned points; there are 4 tests but the total
# points across them is 10.0 points so the scale makes the total
# points available 5.0 points

* Single Point Test
Tests default to 1.0 points for passing which is the case
here. However, the points_scale factor will reduce this to 0.5 points.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
>> echo hello
hello
#+END_SRC

* Two Point Test
#+TESTY: points=2.0

This test is worth 2.0 points (scaled down to 1.0 points).

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
>> echo two point conversion
two point conversion
#+END_SRC

* Three Point Test (fails)
As the name implies, this is worth three points but fails. Due to the
points scale, the penalty is losing 1.5 points.
#+TESTY: points=3.0

#+TESTY: program='bc -iq'
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
>> 1+1+1
2
#+END_SRC

* Four Point Test
#+TESTY: points=4.0

Hopefully the pattern is obvious now
#+TESTY: program='bc -iq'
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
>> 1+2+3+4
10
#+END_SRC
