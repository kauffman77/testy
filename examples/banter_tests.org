This file shows how multi-program testing can be done with the
TESTY_MULTI feature. Using the directive
: #+TESTY: PROGRAM='TESTY_MULTI'
globally or within a test
: #+TESTY: program='TESTY_MULTI'
will interpret the testing session as a set of commands that are
understood natively by testy to start/stop programs, send data and
signals to them, and check that they close down properly.

This file demonstrates TESTY_MULTI with the two programs
~banter_server~ and ~banter_client~ which are shell programs that
affect a sort of local chat server.

* Server Start/Stop
This test starts up a ~banter_server~ and then sends it a signal to
shut down gracefully.

# Start banter_server and refer to the running process with the key 'server' thereafter
